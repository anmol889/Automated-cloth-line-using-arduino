Automated Cloth Line(using Arduino Uno) Feb 2017 â€“ Feb 2017 <br>
Project description :- <br>
An automated cloth-line that pulls clothes inside when it rains. This project mainly consist of " ARDUINO UNO " , " RAIN SENSOR " , and " A MOTOR " .<br>
WORKING : -<br>
The clothesline has a motorized system that works on RAIN SENSOR. When it rains, sensor senses the rain and instruct motor to bind-up the clothes. Actually we set a analog value for the quantity of moisture or rain(say) . So when the analog value of sensor is less than the value we set..clothes will bind-up quickly and oppositely clothes will not bind-up..when there is little moisture on sensor. So here Arduino code helps us to control the working ,according to rain falls on the sensor.
